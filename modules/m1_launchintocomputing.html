									<h3 class="major">Learning Outcomes</h3>
									<p>
										This module introduced the foundational principles of computing and examined how computing systems operate within broader <strong>socio-technical contexts</strong>, where technology, human behaviour, organisational structures, and societal values interact (Walton, 2024).
										It explored core computing disciplines including software engineering, data science, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and enterprise IT, highlighting their role in enabling secure, scalable, and ethical digital systems.
									</p>
									<p>
                                        By completing this module, I developed the ability to critically analyse computing challenges in business contexts, synthesise academic and industry sources, and articulate the legal, ethical, social, and professional considerations that influence computing design and security decisions.
                                    </p>
                                    </br>

									<h3 class="major">Artefacts</h3>
									<h4>Discussion Forum Contributions: Computing as a Socio-Technical Discipline</h4>
									<p>
										This artefact comprises my initial discussion post, peer responses, and reflective summary.
										My initial contribution examined cybersecurity as a socio-technical challenge, drawing on academic frameworks such as the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge and contemporary research to demonstrate how security risks often emerge from interactions between technology, human behaviour, and organisational structures rather than technical flaws alone (CyBOK, 2021; Meyer et al., 2023).

									</p>
									<p>
										The discussion integrated real-world and industry-relevant examples to contextualise theory.
										Tutor feedback highlighted that while my initial post was conceptually strong and well-referenced, my peer responses would benefit from deeper critical engagement.
										This insight informed my reflective summary, which demonstrated improved synthesis and academic awareness.
									</p>
                                    </br>

									<h3 class="major">Reflection</h3>
									<p>
										This module strengthened my understanding of computing as more than a technical discipline, reinforcing the importance of governance, ethics, and human factors in system design and cybersecurity.
										I gained confidence in applying academic Bodies of Knowledge to real-world contexts and learned the importance of engaging critically with peer perspectives to refine arguments.</br>
										Overall, the module enhanced my analytical thinking, academic writing discipline, and ability to connect computing theory with professional cybersecurity practice.
									</p>
                                    </br>

											<ul>
												<li>Strong conceptual understanding of cybersecurity as a socio-technical discipline.</li>
												<li>Effective use of high-quality academic sources.</li>
												<li>Initial discussion post was well structured and robust.</li>
												<li>Peer responses required deeper critical engagement.</li>
												<li>Summary post showed reflective development but could improve synthesis.</li>

									<h3 class="major">Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan</h3>
									<p>
										This module highlighted the need for structured critical engagement in academic discussions.
										My action plan is to allocate dedicated time for peer review, apply comparative analysis when responding to others’ arguments, and explicitly link discussion contributions to academic frameworks and learning outcomes.</br>
										This method will allow me to allocate focused study sessions while maintaining flexibility.</br>
										This will strengthen both my academic performance and professional analytical skills throughout the MSc programme.
