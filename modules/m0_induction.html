									<h3 class="major">Learning Outcomes</h3>
									<p>
										This module introduced the main learning systems and tools used by the University of Essex Online, such as Moodle, the Library, and the Study Skills Hub. It helped me understand how to engage in online learning effectively, participate in learning communities, and organize my study schedule.
										I also learned about academic writing, research techniques, referencing, and reflective learning, skills that will support my progress in future modules.
									</p>

									<p>
                                        By the end of the module, I was able to navigate the virtual learning environment (VLE) confidently, use academic resources, and apply appropriate standards of academic integrity and critical thinking to my written work.
                                    </p>
                                    </br>

									<h3 class="major">Artefacts</h3>
									<h4>My Perspective on e-Portfolio</h4>
									<p>
										This artefact explored the value of an e-Portfolio as a dynamic tool for professional and personal development. </br>
										Coming from the blockchain and digital assets industry, I reflected on how employers in fast-evolving sectors benefit from tangible evidence of skills and competencies. The e-Portfolio serves as a living record of achievements and projects that evolves over time, supporting continuous growth.</br>
										I concluded that maintaining an updated portfolio aligned with career objectives is both a challenge and a necessity for long-term professional credibility.

									</p>

									<h4>Importance of a Postgraduate Degree in Cyber Security</h4>
									<p>
										The second artefact was the written assignment for the induction module.</br>
										It focused on the importance of postgraduate education in the field of Cyber Security, highlighting how advanced study enhances analytical, research, and leadership capabilities required in this growing sector.</br>
										The assignment demonstrated my ability to follow academic writing conventions, apply referencing techniques, and structure arguments clearly in accordance with postgraduate standards.
									</p>
                                    </br>

									<h3 class="major">Reflection</h3>
									<p>
										The induction experience provided a solid foundation for understanding the university’s academic standards.</br>
										Through tutor feedback, I realised that academic writing follows a very specific structure and tone, which initially felt rigid but ultimately provided consistency and clarity. The emphasis on third-person writing and the use of credible, peer-reviewed sources made me more aware of how to maintain professionalism in my future assignments.</br>
										I also learned the importance of reaching the full word count to demonstrate deeper analysis, and how referencing correctly contributes to academic integrity.</br>
										Overall, the module helped me develop confidence in academic writing, time management, and the use of digital learning tools, skills that will support my MSc journey.
									</p>
                                    </br>

									<h3 class="major">Meeting Notes</h3>
									<h4>Feedbacks from the tutor</h4>
									<p>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<ul>
												<li>Good presentation and use of structure.</li>
												<li>Appropriate level of reflection and analysis.</li>
												<li>Need to use <strong>third-person</strong> in future assignments (except reflective work).</li>
												<li>References should be listed in <strong>alphabetical order</strong>.</li>
												<li>Encouragement to use <strong>UoE Library</strong> and <strong>Google Scholar</strong> for academic sources.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</p>
                                    </br>

									<h3 class="major">Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan</h3>
									<p>
										During the induction, I recognised that balancing full-time work, study, and personal commitments requires improved <strong>time management</strong>.</br>
										I plan to apply an <strong>agile approach</strong> to managing my study schedule, treating each week (or 2) like a short iteration, reviewing and adjusting as necessary.</br>
										This method will allow me to allocate focused study sessions while maintaining flexibility.</br>
										My immediate action plan is to establish a weekly timetable dedicated to coursework and reading.</br>
										Through these adjustments, I aim to sustain motivation and ensure consistent academic performance across the MSc programme.
